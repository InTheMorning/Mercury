the arduino will:
    
    - monitor and report 
        - status
        - temperature
        - time
    
    - change status based on 
        - thermostat demands
        - time
        - temperature
    
    - display status via LED

The raspberry pi will:
    - run a thermostat
    - run an interface
    - save settings to file
