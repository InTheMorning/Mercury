the arduino will:
    
    - monitor and report 
        - status
        - temperature
        - time
    
    - change status based on 
        - thermostat demands
        - time
        - temperature
    
    - display status via LED

The raspberry pi will:
    - run a thermostat
    - run an interface
    - save settings to file
    
    
TODO:
    - have distinct preheat and transition warmups
    - save color definitions for modes so they can be called without tripping the hvac state change timestamp
    - check if r,g,b is greater than 255 ?
